![Eunomiac's Text Controls: Text Shadows --- Works With All Sizes And Fonts!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eunomiac/-EunosTextControls/master/images/Header%20-%20Text%20Shadows%200.1.jpg)

I'm running a game that uses a ton of scripts to turn the Roll20 sandbox into an infographic, and that has required me to cobble together all sorts of functions related to Text objects.  As this is the first time I've ever released a script "publicly", I figured I'd start small with the first, and simplest feature: Automatically (or manually; the script is very configurable!) add black shadows to text objects.  

* Fully Plug-And-Play --- Simply add "EunosTextControls.js" (most recent version is accessible under Releases) to a new API script in your game, then restart the sandbox.  Instructions are provided on script startup: You can add/remove shadows from selected text objects with a command, or toggle on automatic shadowing, which will add a text shadow to any new text object created by any player.
* Completely Hands-Off --- Text shadows are created on the map layer (by default), then z-ordered behind their master text objects. Shadows will move when the master object moves; they will update their content, size, color, font, etc. in line with their parent object; and they will remove themselves if their master object is removed. Ideally, you should never have to think about the text shadow objects themselves.
* Tuned for All Fonts & Sizes --- The shadows are positioned depending on the font family and size, for a pleasing look whether you're shadowing a huge heading or a paragraph of body text.  Configuration options clearly marked and commented in the script allow further fine-tuning of these details, if you find a particular font and size combination isn't handled well by the script as-is.

## Future Plans
Below are features I already have coded in my game, but will take a little bit of work to extract out of the tangled web of my own script dependencies. But I plan to add them to this package when I get the chance:

* Text Justification --- By compiling a list of the pixel widths of every character, in every font, at every size, I have functions that left/center/right-justify a text object:  You give it a maximum width in pixels, then line breaks (and white space for padding) are added accordingly.  Similar functions work to align a text object vertically, allowing you to provide a maximum height and width, then set the justification for both axes (how overflows are handled is configurable --- either truncated, truncated with ellipses, or allowed to overflow on a given axis).
* Attribute Linking --- A simple way to link a text object in the sandbox to an attribute on a character, either to display the attribute's current value, or provide a bar showing current value out of max value, or repeat a symbol a number of times equal to the attribute value. The text object will automatically update whenever the linked attribute is changed.
* Permissions --- A minor feature, but this will let the GM give permission to players to edit text objects in the sandbox. (I don't think there's a way to do this outside of a script, so here it is!)
