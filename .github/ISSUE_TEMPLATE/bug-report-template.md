## The Bug vs. Expected Behavior
A quick summary of the problem.  If the behavior you expected instead isn't obvious from the description of the bug, please clear that up for me here, as well.

## To Reproduce
Show me how to reproduce the behavior, so I can test it myself. (Don't worry about exhausting detail --- I'd rather make bug reporting as quick and easy as possible.  Besides, if I can't figure it out, I'll ask.)

### Screenshots
A picture is worth a thousand words, rounded up when it comes to bug squashing.

## Client Details
- What browser are you using?
- In what order are your scripts listed in the "API Scripts" section of your game management page?
- Do you use any addons or other relevant custom features that impact how Roll20 functions on your machine *(e.g. Greasemonkey scripts, VTT Enhancement Suite addon)*?
- Do you use any API scripts in addition to the ones in this repository?
